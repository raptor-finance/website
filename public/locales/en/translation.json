We are not saying that anyone who doesn’t think about climate change is bad, because realistically if you earn 10 dollars a day you, unfortunately, don’t have the time to think about the climate.

Press the \"Stake\" button to stake the amount of Raptor tokens you entered. Now your Raptor Tokens are staked and you'll earn 5% APY."
