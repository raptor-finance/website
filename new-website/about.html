                                Our mission is to heal planet earth and stop climate change by allowing our holders to stake
                                their tokens to generate yield for themselves and ecological projects.

                                PancakeSwap, UniSwap, SushiSwap, and any other token swap exchange due to the quality of
                                the interface and our one of a kind 7% burn fee for transactions (applied to buys/sells)
                                which has been designed to combat the exchange killer known as impermenant loss.

                                we know that it's not farming but for a majority of people to hold their tokens and stake
                                them to the platform. Therefore we have greatly incentivized staking with no time-locks
                                and a generous 5% APY.
                            </p>

                                years before the 2017 bull-run. That bull-run gave me multiple valuable lessons in how
                                markets work, and the volatility of the crypto market and I have been trading ever
                                since. In February 2021 I came up with the idea to make the PhilosoRaptor token.
